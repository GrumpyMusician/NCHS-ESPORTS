Initial~||~12/03/2023~||~Here you say stuff about the event, but keep it short!~||~Hey! You clicked the Learn More button! In here is all the things that you want to go more into detail on. There are no limitations on what you can put in this!
Second Event? Whaaat?~||~12/04/2023~||~That's right! You can copy and paste these div elements, and they will all be different!~||~Everything's different!!! You can keep copy and paste this code and the whole thing will still work. Isn't coding magical?
Text Files!~||~12/05/2023~||~We can now use a text file for creating/generating events.~||~Now the program is generating HTML based off of a text file! It doesn't matter how long or how many lines there are, it will get the job done while still preserving the animations and "learn more" functions.
Navigation~||~12/06/2023~||~Events are now stacked side by side, with buttons to navigate.~||~The buttons will stop working if the user is on the first or last event, or be hidden if all the events fit on the screen!
Image Support~||~12/06/2023~||~We can now put images in the description!~||~Limit one per event, will always be put last. Reminder that parameters in here can be empty!~||~https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.85e29e00d5f2d1c417714407fb7454ab?rik=h75nvzbq%2bJCVTA&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.singing-wings-aviary.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f01%2fZebra-Finch-Pictures.jpg&ehk=na9hE9edLYYSD5GkQIdVEQQjNFh26Xh9h8z%2fpZ7AzD0%3d&risl=1&pid=ImgRaw&r=0
